        <h1>The Web ≠ The Internet</h1>

        <p>The majority of people are ignorant of the difference between the web and the internet.<br>
            The world wide web refers to the sites you access while you are online on a device,<br>
            while the internet refers to the network of linked computers that the web runs on,<br>
            as well as the transmission of emails and data.</p>

        <h2>Origins of the internet</h2>

        <div class="bold">
            <p>Internet is a worldwide network of interconnected computers and related equipment.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Hundreds of pioneering scientists, engineers, and programmers built all of the features and technology that
            formed the Internet as we know it today.
            But its beginnings go back to 1969
            were an idea of an “Intergalactic Network” of computers developed.
            Briefly followed, the idea of "packet switching," a way for efficiently transporting electronic data
            which became one of the internet's most important building elements.
            ARPANET, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, was the first working prototype of the Internet.

        </div>
        <p>as another
            the internet-based notion is built in part on existing services and in part on a new protocol known as HTTP
            (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
            On the Internet, the WWW is a collection of HTTP servers.
            The Web is to blame for a big share of the current growth in Internet activity.
            Many companies and people are now building Web client and server software, and many more are utilizing these
            technologies for a wide range of applications.
            The Network uses hypertext technology to connect a web of documents, which may consist of text, pictures,
            sound,
            video, and other multimedia elements.
            With the launch of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, the web's popularity increased.
            Tim Berners-Lee created the Web in the 90s.
