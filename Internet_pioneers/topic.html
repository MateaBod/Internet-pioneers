        <h1>DNS</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="dns-p1">
        <p>The Domain name system (DNS) is a network service<br> that converts between World Wide Web “name”
            addresses and numeric Internet addresses.<br>
            It was developed because humans prefer names rather than numbers
            so the DNS<br> helped for better communication and overview of the computers.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dns-p2">
        <p>DNS resolves domain names (letters) to IP addresses(numbers) since the computers only understand
            numbers.
            To explain it better I will use an example of a website we are all familiar with.
            To get to Google we can type in its IP address which is 172.217.166.68 but it is long and hard to remember,
            therefore we have DNS which makes it a lot easier.
            By simply typing in google.com the domain name system does the rest of the work.
            It searches its database and matches the name entered with the corresponding IP address then finally
            connects us
            to google.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dns-p3">
        <p>The structure of the DNS is hierarchical which works as followed.
            When we search for an IP address it first checks have we already searched for it before, if yes, it
            automatically finds it locally,
            if not it goes further to the local DNS server searching for it.
            If the address is not found there as well, the DNS server continues the search by breaking the request into
            pieces. It sends the TLD,
            the last part of the name after the dot (www.google.com) to the TLD server.
            The google part of the name will send to a name server and so on until it resolves the requested IP address.
